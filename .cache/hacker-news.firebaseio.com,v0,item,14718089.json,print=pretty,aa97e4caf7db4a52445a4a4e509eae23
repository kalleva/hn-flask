They&#x27;re still great for inspiration, but I suspect we could learn a lot about challenges and wrong approaches from each others&#x27; failures.<p>So what&#x27;s a side project you built hoping to generate revenue from it, that hasn&#x27;t actually earned you much &#x2F; any money?<p>Why do you think it hasn&#x27;t been as successful as you thought it would be &#x2F; what would you do differently if you did it again? How much time&#x2F;money did you spend building it, and what kind of iterations &#x2F; improvements did you make to try and salvage it?<p>Appreciate any and all answers!",
