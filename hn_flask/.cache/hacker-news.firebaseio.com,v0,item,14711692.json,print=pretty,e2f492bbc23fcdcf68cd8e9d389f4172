  "text" : "I manage a lot of VPS servers (Linode,  Digital Ocean) for work. At first, it was no problem to just SSH in and do maintenance, package upgrades, manage iptables, etc, but I don&#x27;t find that this scales well past 10+ or so servers (now have upwards of 20).<p>I&#x27;m aware that there are commercial products available, like Parallels, and Canonical&#x27;s Landscape. However, only some of my servers are running Ubuntu, so that rules out Landscape, and in my limited understanding, running a command panel like Parallels really increases the attack surface on my servers.<p>Currently I use terminator with broadcasting to simultaneously type on multiple terminals. Are there better options? What tools would you recommend?",
