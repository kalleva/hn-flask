I&#x27;m determined not to repeat mistakes of the past.<p>I&#x27;m realizing that the ideal person who I&#x27;d like to interview&#x2F;validate pain-point with is CEO&#x2F;COO&#x2F;someone in a similar capacity. The reason is that my idea falls in a space (more effective collaboration in companies) that concerns them the most - ensuring knowledge is being shared and discussions are taking place across-the-company.<p>Reaching out to CEOs of well-known mid-stage startups on LinkedIn though seems daunting - not because they may ignore the email but because I wonder if this may just be too cold and ineffective a way.<p>What has worked for you when starting cold and prospecting interviewees (at the highest levels) for your customer interviews (pre-product)?",
