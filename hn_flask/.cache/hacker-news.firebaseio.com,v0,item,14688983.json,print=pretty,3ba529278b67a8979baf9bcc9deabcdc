Should it be (new) visitors, conversion rate, app&#x2F;website usage, retention, user satisfaction, all of those..<p>I&#x27;m guessing that on the one hand it would be best to keep tabs on everything, but at the same time that causes you the lose focus. At least I&#x27;ve notived that I&#x27;m most productive when I focus on one thing at a time.  \nAn alternative would be to regularly switch between the different KPIs (Key Performance Indicators, I&#x27;m using the term loosely here).<p>So, what do you consider the most important KPIs for the first 100 users (and which tools do you use to track them)?",
