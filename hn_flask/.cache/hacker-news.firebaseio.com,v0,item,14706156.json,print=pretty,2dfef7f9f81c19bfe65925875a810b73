  "text" : "Hi everyone! My team and I just built a web tool that allows users (in this case, event coordinators, coaches, sales teams, group leaders of any sort) to quickly send bulk SMS texts out to group(s) of recipients. A recipient can respond directly to that SMS and it will only go to original sender. The use cases are pretty open ended...<p>If you&#x27;re interested, send an email to beta@texted.io with the subject “Texted.io Beta” if you try out the product! You’ll get 1000 texts (to send or receive). In exchange, my team and I just ask for some feedback on the project.",
