  "text" : "I recently spoke to a young African-American MIT grad who moved out to Silicon Valley a couple weeks ago to work on his startup in an (unfunded) incubator program.  Unfortunately, his machine is on its last legs and he&#x27;s unable to get another one at the moment.<p>I thought I&#x27;d reach out to the HN community to ask for any creative solutions to help this young man out.  Some of the other incubator members started a GoFundMe for him (email me for URL) but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the most direct approach for solving the problem.<p>Do you have any suggestions as to how we can get this young man a machine to continue his journey as a young entrepreneur?<p>Desired Specs: &quot;Any decent development machine. Preferably 8gb RAM and MacOS or Linux.&quot;<p>Note: This story can be verified with a well-known VC and other reputable folks around Silicon Valley, just ping me for details.",
