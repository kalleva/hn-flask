  "text" : "Hey guys am building a mobile app for a startup that doesn&#x27;t have crazy funding.<p>Atm we are using cloudinary to serve images which seems alright at its pricing.\nAlthough they need to do video as well. I was looking into cloudinary&#x27;s allowances and pricing and it seems to be very expensive for videos.<p>I looked at some other CDN&#x27;s like wowza, amazon cloudfront, akamai but the details on pricing seemed to be lacking or hard to find how much will it actually cost.<p>Anyone has any experience with any of the above and willing to give some insights and how cheaper it will be than cloudinary itself?<p>Here is the cloudinary pricing: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudinary.com&#x2F;pricing  with 120gb storage and 400gb bandwith per month on $224 which I find a bit expensive.<p>Thanks for any suggestions",
