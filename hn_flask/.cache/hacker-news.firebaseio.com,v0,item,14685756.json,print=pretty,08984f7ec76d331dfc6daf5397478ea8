  "text" : "I am angry at myself for being stupid. I worked for 70+ hrs a week for one year and built a new groundbreaking platform. During my recent conversation with my manager, he told me it&#x27;s not enough for promotion and we should wait. I did my best to convince him. \nI am wondering what did I do wrong? Quite frequently I get walked over by people. Although I am good at workplace politics I am not best. I am baffled that men and women who are underperforming are going to be put for promotion. I know first hand two people who have caused delays in projects are going to be considered. All they have is probably strong connection with their managers.<p>How do you navigate workplace politics and getting ahead in the career? Changing job is one option but how long I can keep running from situation?\nAlso,given the state of technical interview and irrationality to ask any irrelevant question, I don&#x27;t know if I wanna go through it again anytime soon.<p>What do I need to do to move ahead and up in the career?",
