But it looks like the comments that I submitted with that account have all been marked as &quot;dead&quot; by the system, and are not visible to users whose &quot;karma&quot; is less than a certain value.  As some posts that I was replying to were submitted by some accounts with very little karma (&lt; 300), I doubt my posts could be seen by them.<p>I tried to put non-trivial information in each of my posts, and I absolutely have not used any aggressive language.  But how can I make those posts visible to some account with little karma, so I could participate in a good discussion in a timely fashion?",
